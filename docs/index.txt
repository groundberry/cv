Experience

Oct 2013 – Aug 2016

    SUSTAINABILITY CONSULTANT at _Little Bee Community_ _(London, UK)_

    Managed a wide range of projects locally and abroad, ensuring goals
    are met on time and on budget. Examples of projects and tasks I have
    worked on are:

    -   Completed a feasibility study of a water-efficient agricultural
        system using hydroponics in Ghana.
    -   Developed a compact hydroponic food-growing system for
        urban settings. It yields double the amount, and uses up to 13
        times less water than traditional soil based agriculture — 40
        litres of water per sqm every 2 weeks (an equivalent of
        0.012 litres/plant/day).
    -   Created an internal database of agricultural techniques and best
        practices based on research.
    -   Created a complete database of funding opportunities for a wide
        range of projects.
    -   Created evaluation reports and wrote shortlisted funding
        proposals and tender applications.
    -   Created marketing documents and training material using
        InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop.
    -   Supported and managed volunteers and other team members giving
        guidance on task performance.
    -   Managed suppliers reducing up to 20% the budget spent on
        materials and services.
    -   Attended conferences and networking events as a representative
        of LBC.
    -   Organised and delivered events and workshops.
