Skills

Project Management

I’ve shown strong ability breaking projects into smaller tasks while
working at Little Bee Community. I managed a project in Africa, creating
a three-year timeline that included monthly and weekly tasks, cost
tracking, and list of suppliers. This structured workflow made it easier
to deliver the project on time and on budget.

Adaptability

For the last five years I have been experiencing big changes in my life,
and I managed to successfully overcome them by focusing on my strengths
and abilities. My last challenge, a career change, started one year ago
when I began learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript by myself. I then decided
to join Makers Academy, a 12-week bootcamp where I learnt Ruby, Rails,
Node, and React, to name a few technologies. It has been an amazing and
satisfying journey!

Communication and Collaboration

My colleagues at Makers highlight my empathy, patience, and ability to
explain concepts clearly as my main skills. For example, on one
specially challenging week I noticed that my colleague was struggling
with understanding how a Node app works. I helped her analyse the
project’s structure and data flow. By the end of the day we managed to
have a server up and running!

Design and User Experience

I’m passionate about crafting attractive and user-friendly interfaces
for every project I work on. I have taught myself CSS, Bootstrap,
Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. I have used these skills to create
appealing and usable apps in personal projects, and marketing materials
for Little Bee Community and Battle McCarthy.
