Personal projects

SAFE WATER – _React, Jest, Enzyme, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL_ –
Ongoing

Single-page app that helps users know the quality of drinking water in
their area. The responsive user interface in the front-end communicates
with a back-end that retrieves data from a database, and highlights
dangerous levels for each contaminant.

FLICKR GALLERY – _React, Jest, Enzyme, Sinatra_ – 5 days

Single-page app with a front-end that queries the Flickr API for cute
photos through a proxy that deals with authentication and CORS.

FLASHCARDS – _React, Jest, Enzyme, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, GitHub OAuth,
PostgreSQL_ – 45 days

Self-service tool for users to learn through spaced repetition. It
allows them to create, edit, and delete flashcards. The front-end makes
requests to an API in the back-end, fetching tags and flashcards for the
logged in user.

CSS PLAYGROUND – _React, Jest, HTML5, CSS3_ – 10 days

Final project at Makers Academy. A live-editing HTML and CSS tool that
allows users with no coding experience to create basic website drafts,
and download the code.


Skills

PROJECT MANAGEMENT – I’ve shown strong ability breaking projects into
smaller tasks while working at Little Bee Community. I managed a project
in Africa, creating a three-year timeline that included monthly and
weekly tasks, cost tracking, and list of suppliers. This structured
workflow made it easier to deliver the project on time and on budget.

ADAPTABILITY – For the last five years I have been experiencing big
changes in my life, and I managed to successfully overcome them by
focusing on my strengths and abilities. My last challenge, a career
change, started one year ago when I began learning HTML, CSS and
JavaScript by myself. I then decided to join Makers Academy, a 12-week
bootcamp where I learnt Ruby, Rails, Node, and React, to name a few
technologies.

COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION – My colleagues at Makers highlight my
empathy, patience, and ability to explain concepts clearly as my main
skills. For example, on one specially challenging week I noticed that my
colleague was struggling with understanding how a Node app works. I
helped her analyze the project’s structure and data flow. By the end of
the day we managed to have a server up and running!

DESIGN AND USER EXPERIENCE – I’m passionate about crafting attractive
and user-friendly interfaces for every project I work on. I have taught
myself CSS, Bootstrap, Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. I have used
these skills to create appealing and usable apps in personal projects,
and marketing materials for Little Bee Community and Battle McCarthy.
