Personal projects

These are some of my side projects. You can see more in my Portfolio
page or my GitHub profile.

FLASHCARDS – _React, Jest, Enzyme, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, GitHub OAuth,
PostgreSQL_ – 45 days

-   A self-service tool for users to learn through spaced repetition.
-   Once the user is authenticated, they are able to create, edit, and
    delete flashcards.
-   I split the front-end logic into smaller, stateless, well-tested
    components.
-   High test coverage helped keep complexity under control and
    implement bug-free logic.
-   Having gained more than 40 users in the first month after being
    released, it had really good acceptance and received valuable
    feedback from real users.
