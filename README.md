## Skills

### Project Management

I've shown strong ability breaking projects into smaller tasks while working at [Little Bee Community](#experience). I managed a project in Africa, creating a three-year timeline that included monthly and weekly tasks, cost tracking, and list of suppliers. This structured workflow made it easier to deliver the project on time and on budget.

### Adaptability

For the last five years I have been experiencing big changes in my life, and I managed to successfully overcome them by focusing on my strengths and abilities. My last challenge, a career change, started one year ago when I began learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript by myself. I then decided to join Makers Academy, a 12-week bootcamp where I learnt Ruby, Rails, Node, and React, to name a few technologies. It has been an amazing and satisfying journey!

### Communication and Collaboration

My colleagues at Makers highlight my empathy, patience, and ability to explain concepts clearly as my main skills. For example, on one specially challenging week I noticed that my colleague was struggling with understanding how a Node app works. I helped her analyse the project's structure and data flow. By the end of the day we managed to have a server up and running!

### Design and User Experience

I'm passionate about crafting attractive and user-friendly interfaces for every project I work on. I have taught myself CSS, Bootstrap, Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. I have used these skills to create appealing and usable apps in personal projects, and marketing materials for [Little Bee Community](#experience) and [Battle McCarthy](#experience).
