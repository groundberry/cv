    * Created an internal database of agricultural techniques and best practices based on research.
    * Created a complete database of funding opportunities for a wide range of projects.
    * Created evaluation reports and wrote shortlisted funding proposals and tender applications.
    * Created marketing documents and training material using InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop.
