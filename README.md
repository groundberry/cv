## Personal projects

**[Safe Water](https://github.com/groundberry/water-client)** -- *React, Jest, Enzyme, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL* -- Ongoing

Single-page app that helps users know the quality of drinking water in their area. The responsive user interface in the [front-end](https://github.com/groundberry/water-client) communicates with a [back-end](https://github.com/groundberry/water-server) that retrieves data from a database, and highlights dangerous levels for each contaminant.

**[Flickr Gallery](https://groundberry.github.io/flickr-client)** -- *React, Jest, Enzyme, Sinatra* -- 5 days

Single-page app with a [front-end](https://github.com/groundberry/flickr-client) that queries the Flickr API for cute photos through a [proxy](https://github.com/groundberry/flickr-proxy) that deals with authentication and CORS.

**[Flashcards](https://groundberry.github.io/flashcards-client/)** -- *React, Jest, Enzyme, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, GitHub OAuth, PostgreSQL* -- 45 days

Self-service tool for users to learn through spaced repetition. It allows them to create, edit, and delete flashcards. The [front-end](https://github.com/groundberry/flashcards-client) makes requests to an API in the [back-end](https://github.com/groundberry/flashcards-server), fetching tags and flashcards for the logged in user.

**[CSS playground](https://css-play.herokuapp.com)** -- *React, Jest, HTML5, CSS3* -- 10 days

Final project at Makers Academy. A [live-editing HTML and CSS tool](https://github.com/groundberry/CSS-playground) that allows users with no coding experience to create basic website drafts, and download the code.


## Skills

**Project Management** -- I've shown strong ability breaking projects into smaller tasks while working at [Little Bee Community](#experience). I managed a project in Africa, creating a three-year timeline that included monthly and weekly tasks, cost tracking, and list of suppliers. This structured workflow made it easier to deliver the project on time and on budget.

**Adaptability** -- For the last five years I have been experiencing big changes in my life, and I managed to successfully overcome them by focusing on my strengths and abilities. My last challenge, a career change, started one year ago when I began learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript by myself. I then decided to join Makers Academy, a 12-week bootcamp where I learnt Ruby, Rails, Node, and React, to name a few technologies.

**Communication and Collaboration** -- My colleagues at Makers highlight my empathy, patience, and ability to explain concepts clearly as my main skills. For example, on one specially challenging week I noticed that my colleague was struggling with understanding how a Node app works. I helped her analyze the project's structure and data flow. By the end of the day we managed to have a server up and running!

**Design and User Experience** -- I'm passionate about crafting attractive and user-friendly interfaces for every project I work on. I have taught myself CSS, Bootstrap, Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. I have used these skills to create appealing and usable apps in personal projects, and marketing materials for [Little Bee Community](#experience) and [Battle McCarthy](#experience).
