## Personal projects

These are some of my side projects. You can see more in my [Portfolio](https://groundberry.github.io/portfolio.html) page or my [GitHub](https://github.com/groundberry) profile.

**[Flashcards](https://groundberry.github.io/flashcards-client/)** -- *React, Jest, Enzyme, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, GitHub OAuth, PostgreSQL* -- 45 days

- A self-service tool for users to learn through spaced repetition.
- Once the user is authenticated, they are able to create, edit, and delete flashcards.
- I split the front-end logic into smaller, stateless, well-tested components.
- High test coverage helped keep complexity under control and implement bug-free logic.
- Having gained more than 40 users in the first month after being released, it had really good acceptance and received valuable feedback from real users.

**[CSS Playground](https://css-play.herokuapp.com)** -- *React, Jest, Enzyme, HTML5, CSS3* -- 10 days -- Final project at Makers Academy

- A live-editing HTML and CSS tool built by a team of 4.
- Users with no coding experience can create basic website drafts, and download the code.
- Despite being my first time using React, I became productive after just one week.
- I played a key role making sure every member of the team felt heard and valued.
